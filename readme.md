# Slip Ring

A two-conductor slip ring, made from 1/2" copper pipe, brushes from an old motor, ball bearings, and some 3D printed parts to hold it together.

I needed a slip ring to add neopixels to a prize wheel. I couldn't find one that worked with what I had on hand, so I designed this.

While I think it should be easy enough to adapt to other sizes, it is fairly specific to the pipe, bearings, and brushes I could find.
